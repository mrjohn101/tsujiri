  <h1>TSUJIRI History</h1>
  <p>
    Dated back in 1860, it was the end of the ancient Edo period, which also marked the start of the brand TSUJIRI that was first established by Riemon Tsuji in Uji, Kyoto, Japan. The founder Riemon tapped his own wealth to improve the tea industry,
    advancing and innovating the method to enhance the flavors and sweetness of the tea to produce the highest quality Gyokuro tea leaves.
    He also created a tea cabinet to prolong the freshness of the tea leaves, which means that TSUJIRI’s teas are equally fresh as compared to the ones found in other parts of Japan. Riemon’s effort was well-recognised by many and to attest to that,
    his statue was built in Byodoin, the world heritage temple in Kyoto.</p>
